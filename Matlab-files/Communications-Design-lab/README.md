Codes for  the following topics can be accessed as MATLAB(.m) files.

## Contents

1. Modulation techniques
    - Amplitude modulation
    - Frequency modulation
    - Amplitude shift keying
    - Frequency shift keying
    - Phase shift keying
 
2. Dual Tone Multiple Frequency(DTMF)
    - The program is an example to show how a number could be selected based on two tones that are generated or
   vice versa in a telephone communication. The matrices 'x' and 'y' are the combinations of frequencies that we 
   use to produce the numbers. Each number is assigned a unique combination of frequencies to produce the tone.

3. Antennas
    - Helical antenna
    - Monopole antenna
